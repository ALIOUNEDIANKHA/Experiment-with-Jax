        "This guide summarizes some tips, tricks and practices that are useful when working with JAX for a research project. In my opinion, one key aspect that JAX is missing compared to PyTorch is a framework like [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that can massively reduce code overhead while still being flexible enough for supporting almost any model/task. Although there exist such libraries for certain common tasks, like [trax](https://github.com/google/trax) or [scenic](https://github.com/google-research/scenic) (attention-based CV), I have not come across one so far which was sufficiently flexible for my research. Hence, in this guide, we build a simpler version of a PyTorch Lightning trainer, that summarizes all training, logging, etc. behavior that we need for almost any model, and allows training various models with much fewer lines than from scratch. Moreover, we implement some simple examples to showcase possible training structures, and underline its flexibility by performing automatic hyperparameter tuning with [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). Since this guide will be about code structures, it is more code-heavy than the other guides and can also be run in Google Colab if preferred.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's import some standard libraries. For this guide, we will use the data loading functionalities of PyTorch, but one could also use the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) dataset API. Additionally, we integrate loggers from PyTorch Lightning since they support a flexible API and have most popular logging application implemented (e.g. [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site))."

        "\n",
        "As seen in previous tutorials, [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) gives us already some basic functionalities for training models. One part of it is the `TrainState`, which holds the model parameters and optimizers, and allows updating it. However, there might be more model aspects that we would like to add to the `TrainState`. For instance, if a model uses Batch Normalization as in [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html), we need to keep the batch statistics in order to evaluate the models on a test dataset. Furthermore, many models contain stochastic elements such as dropout or sampling in generative models (e.g. [Normalizing Flows](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial11/NF_image_modeling.html)). Thus, we extend the `TrainState` class from Flax to also include the batch statistics as `batch_stats` and a pseudo-random number generation `rng`. Note that if models do not require these elements, they can simply be `None` without breaking our code."

        "Now we already come to the main part of this guide: the Trainer module for JAX/Flax. The shown module here is not meant to be the 'one and only' way of doing it, and is more meant as showcasing one possible option of obtaining a Lightning-like API in JAX. The module can easily be extended by more functionalities, depending on what is needed/preferred by the individual users.\n",
        "\n",
        "First let's make a list of functionalities that we would want the Trainer module to include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Logging**: For basically all usecases and models, we want to log our hyperparameters, training/validation performance, and model checkpoints. For the second point, we can make use of PyTorch Lightning's logger classes like `TensorBoardLogger` and `WandbLogger`. For the model checkpoints, we use `flax.checkpoints`. In terms of flexibility, the trainer should support arbitrary sets of hyperparameters, since different models may require different hyperparameters. Similarly, it should be easy to add new metrics for logging, like accuracy for classification or intersection over union for segmentation.\n",
        "    * Implemented in: `init_logger`, `save_model`, `load_model`, `save_metrics`\n",
        "* **Model state initialization**: In contrast to PyTorch, JAX separates the model itself from the learnable parameters. Creating a set of parameters for a model requires some boiler-template code, like creating a PRNG for the parameter generation and creating an initial `TrainState`. At the same time, we need to allow overwriting the `model.init` code, since different architectures will have different input arguments for the forward pass (e.g. models with dropout require a dropout-PRNG).\n",
        "    * Implemented in: `init_model`, `run_model_init`, `print_tabulate`\n",
        "* **Optimizer initialization**: Following with the parameter initialization, we also need to create an optimizer and its eventual parameters (e.g. momentum and adaptive learning rate parameters in Adam). Since most models use a similar set of optimizers (SGD or Adam) and extra functionalities like gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling, we can write a template method that creates an optimizers based on some hyperparameters. However, it should be possible to overwrite this method if very specific optimizer settings/learning rate schedulers are needed. Since some schedulers require information about the overall number of training iterations, we create the optimizer right before starting the training.\n",
        "    * Implemented in: `init_optimizer`\n",
        "* **Training loop**: Most models follow a similar training procedure where we train a model for several epoch on the training dataset, and evaluate it in between on the validation dataset. If a model is better than all previous models, we want to save its weight for loading them potentially later. Importantly, however, each model will have a very different training and validation step. Thus, similarly to PyTorch Lightning, we expect that an inheriting Trainer module has to define a training step function and evaluation step function, that can be jitted and used in the training loop. This is implemented in the function `train_model`, `train_epoch`, `eval_model`, `create_functions`, `create_jitted_functions`. Additional aspects to consider include:\n",
        "    * Whether a model is better than the previous ones or not depends on the task at hand. For example, classification models are usually compared by their accuracy, trying to achieve the maximum value, while regression models aim for the lowest loss. Hence, we need a flexible API to support different ways of comparing models and finding the best one. Implemented in: `is_new_model_better`\n",
        "    * Within the training loop, we might want to perform additional operations, like logging reconstruction examples of an autoencoder after every few epochs. To do so, PyTorch Lightning provides functions that are called at different stages during training, which we can similarly integrate in our Trainer module. Implemented in: `on_training_start`, `on_training_epoch_end`, `on_validation_epoch_end`\n",
        "    * Depending on whether we run the model on a cluster with no display or on our local machine, we might want to see progress bars that track the training progress. Hence, the Trainer module should have to switch to enable or disable these progress bars. Implemented in: `tracker`\n",
        "* **Inference**: After we have finished training, we might want to load a model at a later time and perform inference experiments with it. For example, in [Tutorial 9](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial9/AE_CIFAR10.html), we use a trained autoencoder for an image search engine. To support this, two functionalities are needed: (1) loading a model from disk, including its hyperparameters (i.e. the function `load_from_checkpoint` in PyTorch Lightning), and (2) binding parameters to a model to reduce code overhead. Both parts can be implemented in our Trainer module.\n",
        "    * Implemented in: `load_from_checkpoint`, `bind_model` \n",
        "\n",
        "With these requirements in mind, let's finally implement the module. Note that it is a considerably long code cell since we want to support many different settings. We recommend to take some time to go through the code and understand how all the elements are implemented, and how one can extend it depending on their own needs."

For the regression task and the small model, this reduces to writing the mean-squared error loss. Note that we still have some minor repetitive code here, such as creating the gradient function with `jax.value_and_grad` in the training step and applying the update with `state.apply_gradients`. One could reduce this further by restricting possible loss functions, but to keep flexibility high, we implement the whole training step here."

We have done it before in [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html), but here, we want to showcase the flexibility of the Trainer module. For that, we will consider a more complicated setting in Flax: a model with both Batch Normalization and Dropout. However, with the Trainer module, this reduces to a simpler code again."

In these functions, we take care of the mutable batch statistics and the PRNG state for dropout. Note that since both parts are integrated in the `TrainState`, we do not need to alternate the training or validation step signature, and it is sufficient to pass the state and batch to the functions. Additionally, we overwrite the model call during initialization (`run_model_init`) and tabulate function (`print_tabulate`). And that's it! Overall, we didn't need to make many changes, showing that the trainer module is flexible enough to support a variety of layers. For now, we can ignore the `trial` object and come back to it later when discussing automated hyperparameter tuning."

In our case, the objective is to optimize the validation accuracy of the MLP. Note that we do not use the test set here, since hyperparameter searches should only be done on the validation set, not the \"unseen\" test set! The function below, `objective(trial)`, creates a MLP with our trainer module and trains it for max. 200 epochs. The input argument, `trial`, is thereby an object which characterizes the current run. This includes, for example, the hyperparameters we want to optimize. In order to add a hyperparameter to our optimization set, we can simply call `trial.suggest_float` for continuous values and `trial.suggest_categorical` for categorical values (e.g. which optimizer to use). For the CIFAR10 classification, we consider the following three hyperparameters: dropout rate, weight decay, and the learning rate, which we define below. Finally, we return the best validation accuracy which will be used by Optuna to guide the next pick of hyperparameters."

For more information, check out the [documentation](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.samplers.TPESampler.html#optuna.samplers.TPESampler). The studies are usually stored in a database format, but can be easily accessed via the Python interface of Optuna. Let's run the hyperparameter search for up to 25 models:"

        "During the study creation, we used the input argument `pruner`. This specifies a strategy with which we want to stop experiments early if they don't look promising. For instance, a very low learning rate combined with high weight decay and dropout will likely achieve low performance, which we can already judge after 50 epochs and don't have to run the model for much longer. For this, we implemented the `on_validation_epoch_end` callback in our Trainer module before. After each epoch, it reports the current validation performance to Optuna. Depending on the previous performances and Optuna's pruning strategy, it may decide to stop the experiment early, which it does by throwing a `TrialPruned` error. This error is caught by Optuna, and the next trial is directly started."

To showcase the flexibility of the module, we implement a regression and classification model in a few lines. Moreover, we show how one can easily perform automatic hyperparameter optimization with Optuna in this setting. While this guide gives a possible template for a research code, it may not cover all parts that is needed for your specific usecase. Moreover, if you are specialized on a certain task, such as classification or generative models, you can further specialize the Trainer module to reduce your code for submodules."
